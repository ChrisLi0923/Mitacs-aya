[11/993] The object in the red box is a large marine mammal, specifically a humpback whale, that is partially submerged in the water. It can be distinguished from the other objects in the image by its massive size, dark coloration, and the distinctive shape of its back and dorsal fin. Unlike the birds that are flying above the water, this whale has a streamlined body adapted for swimming and is characterized by its smooth, glossy skin and the absence of feathers. The whale's blowhole is visible near the top of its head, which is a feature unique to cetaceans. Additionally, the whale's movements create significant disturbances in the water, forming large splashes and waves around it, further setting it apart from the smaller, more agile birds that are scattered across the surface of the ocean.

[13/993] The object in the red box consists of two dolphins swimming side by side in the ocean. The dolphins are positioned close to each other, with their bodies almost touching. The leading dolphin has its head slightly turned to the right, while the trailing dolphin appears to be following closely behind. Both dolphins have sleek, streamlined bodies with smooth skin that reflects the surrounding blue water. Their fins are visible, with the dorsal fins on their backs and the pectoral fins on their sides. The dolphins' tails, or flukes, are also visible, propelling them through the water. The overall scene captures the graceful movement and companionship of these marine mammals in their natural habitat.

[14/993] The object in the red box is a dolphin leaping out of the water. It is positioned slightly to the right of the center of the image, with its body arched gracefully in mid-air. The dolphin's dorsal fin is clearly visible, and its tail is extended behind it as it soars above the surface of the deep blue ocean. The spray of water around the dolphin adds to the dynamic nature of the scene, highlighting the dolphin's movement and the force with which it has breached the water. This particular dolphin is distinct from the other one in the image, which is not enclosed in a red box, and from the surrounding ocean waves and splashes due to its elevated position and the unique shape of its body in flight.

[15/993] The object in the red box consists of two dolphins leaping out of the water in unison, performing an acrobatic maneuver. They are positioned side by side, with their bodies arched gracefully and their tails submerged. The dolphins are surrounded by a splash of water, indicating the force and speed of their leap. Above them, there is a metal structure with horizontal bars, which the dolphins appear to be using as a support or guide for their performance. The background shows a blue pool with clear water, and a platform can be seen in the distance. The overall scene suggests a controlled environment, likely a marine park or aquarium, where the dolphins are trained to perform tricks for an audience.

[323/993] The object in the red box is a beautiful example of a spider web. What makes it stand out is its intricate and delicate structure. The web is composed of fine, silken threads that are arranged in a complex pattern, forming a circular or oval shape.
